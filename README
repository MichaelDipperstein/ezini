DESCRIPTION
-----------
This archive contains an ANSI C library implementing INI file reading and
writing.  This library is intended to be easy to use and build upon.  It is
small in size, thus not as feature complete as other libraries, but should
be sufficient to meet most requirements.

FILES
-----
COPYING         - GNU General Public License v3
COPYING.LESSER  - GNU Lesser General Public License v3
ezini.c         - Library implementing INI parsing and writing functions
ezini.h         - Function and type definitions for the ezini library
Makefile        - makefile for this project (assumes gcc compiler and GNU make)
README          - this file
sample.c        - Program demonstrating how to use the ezini library.

BUILDING
--------
To build these files with GNU make and gcc, simply enter "make" from the
command line.

USAGE
-----
sample.c demonstrates usage of ezini functions and provides implementations
for two different style callback functions.

LIBRARY API
-----------
Writing INI File:
int MakeINI(const char *iniFile, ini_entry_t *entries, const size_t count)
iniFile
    A pointer to the INI file to be made.  The file must be opened for writing.
entries
    A pointer to an array of ini_entry_t type elements that will be used to
    create the INI file.
count
    The number of elements in the array pointed to by entries.
Return Value
    0 for success
    -1 for failure.  Error type is contained in errno.

Getting INI File Entries:
int GetEntry(FILE *iniFile, ini_entry_t *entry)
iniFile
    A pointer to the INI file to be parsed.  The file must be opened for
    reading.
entry
    A pointer to the entry structure used to store the discovered
    (section, key, value) triple.
Return Value
    1 for success
    0 if no triples were discovered
    -1 for failure.  Error type is contained in errno.

HISTORY
-------
12/20/15 - Initial release
03/06/16 - Changed function that gets INI entries to be more like getopt
           instead of using callback functions
         - Use open FILE pointer instead of full path to INI file

TODO
----
- Add functions for updating existing INI files
- Add option to MakeINI not to overwrite existing INI file
