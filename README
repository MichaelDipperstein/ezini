DESCRIPTION
-----------
This archive contains an ANSI C library implementing INI file reading and
writing.  This library is intended to be easy to use and build upon.  It is
small in size, thus not as feature complete as other libraries, but should
be sufficient to meet most requirements.

FILES
-----
COPYING         - GNU General Public License v3
COPYING.LESSER  - GNU Lesser General Public License v3
ezini.c         - Library implementing INI parsing and writing functions
ezini.h         - Function and type definitions for the ezini library
Makefile        - makefile for this project (assumes gcc compiler and GNU make)
README          - this file

BUILDING
--------
To build these files with GNU make and gcc, simply enter "make" from the
command line.

USAGE
-----
sample.c demonstrates usage of ezini functions and provides implementations
for two different style callback functions.

LIBRARY API
-----------
Parsing INI File:
int ParseIni(FILE *iniFile, parse_cb callback, void *userData)
iniFile
    The INI file stream to be parsed.  It must be opened.
    NULL pointers will return an error.
callback
    A pointer to the callback function to be called when a (section, key, value)
    triple is discovered.
userData
    A pointer to data to be passed to the callback function
Return Value
    Zero for success, -1 for failure.  Error type is contained in errno.
