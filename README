DESCRIPTION
-----------
This archive contains an ANSI C library implementing INI file reading and
writing.  This library is intended to be easy to use and build upon.  It is
small in size, thus not as feature complete as other libraries, but should
be sufficient to meet most requirements.

FILES

ezini.c         - Library implementing INI parsing and writing functions
ezini.h         - Function and type definitions for the ezini library
Makefile        - makefile for this project (assumes gcc compiler and GNU make)
README          - this file

BUILDING
--------
To build these files with GNU make and gcc, simply enter "make" from the
command line.

USAGE
-----
sample.c demonstrates usage of ezini functions.

(section, key, value) triples are stored in entry structures (ini_entry_t) and
multiple entry structures may be linked together in an entry list
(ini_entry_list_t).

Read an INI file by calling GetEntryFromFile until it returns 0.

Write an INI file by using AddEntryToList to build an entry list, then call
MakeINIFile to make a file from the entry list.  Call FreeEntryList when
you are done.

HISTORY
-------
12/20/15 - Initial release
03/06/16 - Changed function that gets INI entries to be more like getopt
           instead of using callback functions
         - Use open FILE pointer instead of full path to INI file
05/15/16 - Added functions to add and delete entries from INI file
         - Made function names consistent
08/14/16 - Reformatted comments for Doxygen documentation

TODO
----
- Add option to MakeINI not to overwrite existing INI file
